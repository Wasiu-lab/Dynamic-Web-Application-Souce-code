# Learn It Right Way
This project is a full-stack web application built using React js for the frontend, Express js for the backend, and MySQL as the database. The application is designed to demonstrate the implementation of a 3-tier architecture, where the presentation layer (React js), application logic layer (Express js), and data layer (MySQL) are separated into distinct tiers.
